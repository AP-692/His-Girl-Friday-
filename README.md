The classic film His Girl Friday is a noteworthy film that is as relevant today, as it was in 1940. This adaptation came from a Broadway comedy called The Front Page by Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht which had been adapted to a film previously in 1931, directed by Lewis Milestone.  However, during a readthrough the director Howard Hawks decided to cast a woman as one of the protagonists.  The discovery that the part of Hildy Johnson worked as a female character allowed the film to change the initial story, elevating it beyond a straightforward comedy. Developing the film from being about the newspaper’s shenanigans to being about equality of the sexes and gender dynamics. With hidden topics just under the surface that are not noticed upon first viewing; is His Girl Friday just a classic screwball comedy, or is it attempting to explore into more serious political questions of the 1940s? James Walters points at the ‘moral ambiguity’ that persists throughout the film, with subplots involving graft, prostitution, racism, suicide and murder hidden under the comedic trope.  His Girl Friday is a typical comedy from the 1930s and early 1940’s, the films of this era impress upon how slow witted, reticent or in-articulated women had little chance for sexual happiness and professional success.  Although Hawks touches on some political questions for the era with his subplots this source analysis will focus of the feminism of the film and look into, how after World War II women wanted to see less flapper girl and called for a resurgence of a tough women.

His Girl Friday is a light-hearted screwball comedy romance, directed by Howard Hawks, released in January 1940. However, Hawks put spin on one of the lead characters Hildy Johnson, initially scripted for Broadway, Hawks decided to put a contemporary spin on his film adaptation by casting a female in a previously male written role. Hawks changing the lead from male to female shows how ‘talking pictures’ have the ability to influence viewers.  The outspoken, confident lead character is portrayed as a fast-talking dame, newspaperman and someone who is seen as an equal to a man in a male-dominated business.  This view allowed women the opportunity to speak up and speak out to their desires, dreams and ambitions.  With single girls of the era demanding a ‘take me as I am instead of changing me’ attitude like that of the character Hildy.  Film theorist Peter Wollen claims that systematic knowledge of the director's worldview can alter the meaning of a film.  Wollen places Hawks’ comedies including His Girl Friday through auteur analysis to a ‘systematic series of oppositions’ or ‘antinomic pairs.’  The theme of sex reversal and role reversal in the film masculinises women and infantilises men.  However, His Girl Friday does more than a simple reversal of the binary oppositions it represents; it deconstructs the very logic through which such oppositions produce meaning.  

His Girl Friday fits within the ‘screwball comedy’ genre that arose in the mid-1930s. Based on the common ‘boy meets girls’ formula gone ‘topsy-turvy,’ presenting a female-dominated lead.  Professor of film studies Leger Grindon advises that His Girl Friday demonstrated the change in gender roles after World War I. The female character of Hildy is treated as an equal to that of the male characters.  The ramification of this adaptation to the lead character transports Hawks’ film into an debate of gender politics, exploring how a female reporter can exist within the ostensibly male world of newspaper reporting.  Author Thomas C Renzi states that ‘while the particular reason for screwball’s battle of the sexes may vary among films, the fundamental nature of the conflict in the comedies depends on the man and woman working at cross-purposes to each other: the man’s goal interferes with the women, and vice versa.’  In His Girl Friday Walter Burns’ one aim is to win Hildy back, to him and the paper, this is seen by Walter as one aim Walter believes he is the paper. Whereas Hildy believes she is finished being a ‘newspaperman’ and is determined to take on the role of the housewife and be a woman with a home. 

-	Walter Burns: You're a newspaperman.
-	 Hildy Johnson: That's why I'm quitting. I want to go someplace where I can be a woman.
-	Walter Burns: You mean "be a traitor".
-	Hildy: A traitor to what? 
-	Walter: To journalism.

The opening sequence of the films sets the battle of the sex’s trope depicting Hildy as not just equal to men but, Walters equal. Hildy is distinguished from both the men and the women in the scene, dressed in a pinstriped suit with a top hat. This represents Hildy as masculine while the pattern is feminine, this identifies her as someone who is between genders. Author Heidi Wilkins states that the hat Hildy wears has more meaning than that of just a hat, it places her at the same height as the men, and visually positions Hildy as having status in the office.  The whole of Hildy’s presence when entering from the elevator is that of confidence and ownership, she also speaks in a lower tone than that of the other women. Her tone and manner of speech is socially determined and associates her as a person of importance. Wilkins states Hildy’s tone is ‘linked to an individual’s status within a given social system, such as a place of work.’ 


The mise-en-scène and cinematography of the first scene around the ‘NO ADDMITANCE’ gate gives information on dialogue through character action. Hildy’s masculinity as she reaches for the gate to enter and pushes against Bruce’s chest, signalling that he must wait passively outside its limits.  Hildy’s passage through the gate and Bruce’s exclusion from the workstation are aberrations. This initial scene marks Hildy as an exception in a male environment. Bruce’s status becomes suspect also when she tells him over her shoulder that she will only be ten minutes.

-Bruce Baldwin: Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.  

This line from Bruce makes him sound like a stereotypical melodramatic woman, a view of women that was believed by many. This scene shows how the film subverts the stereotypical gender roles between men and women.  As Hildy walks through the office she is treated as both one of the men and one of the women being respected by both genders gaining her a high place in the office hierarchy.  When Hildy speaks with Walter to advise him that she is engaged and leaving ’The Morning Post’ viewers experience the witty banter between the two characters. The banter between the characters plays into the battle of the sex trope allowing the characters to be seen as equals, creating a fair and level playground upon which they can compete.  

According to Howard Good, Torchy Blane was one of the first independent women on screen she ‘didn’t challenge the old notion of woman as the weaker sex; she just reproduced it in a more contemporary and insidious form’ with her, ‘frenetic energy, rapid-fire repartee, and man-tailored suits.’  The standard of which women are judged does not change a women reporter is still measured and judged on professional success, and marital status with a constant expectation that a women will give up her career for domestic life. Professor Verna Kale stated that Torchy Blane, Hildy Johnson and Brenda Starr offer a version of how female reporters protect their professional identity by continually entertaining but eventually deterring, chances of marriage.  A balance must be maintained for the female reporter to be viable in the ’entertainment industry’ and as a ’marketable commodity’. Kale advises in a fictional world being a ’Girl Friday’ or ’Bombshell’ a balance needs to exist between being an independent career woman and sexually available.  Hildy is a particular type of women she is career driven, impeccably dressed and exudes confidence.  Author Robin Wood alludes to the films ’disturbing complexity of tone’ but not from Hildy’s lack of empathy or the underworld developments that occur.  It is due to the fact that the audience is not granted a happy ending that is expected with romantic comedies, and how in the end Hildy will not find happiness with either Bruce or Walter as first and foremost she is a reporter.  A reporter at the court house as he looks over Hildy’s write up says: ’Anybody who can write like that won't give it up to sew socks.’  Finally, Hildy admits to herself ’I'm no suburban bridge player. I’m a newspaperman.’  Realising that she is not the kind of women that can marry a timid, gullible, feeble man such as Bruce. The end scene shows that she will never get her happy ending and she comes to term with this, choosing Walter as he is the lesser risk of the two.  Ending on an ambiguous note with the reoccurring issues already showing between Walter and Hildy.

In conclusion Hildy represents and demonstrates a woman of strength and independence this allows her to be comfortable in a masculine domain, however, this alienates her from her own gender.  With modern career woman in tropes still recognizable to audiences today.  Hildy goes toe-to-toe with Walter holding her own making her a competent woman in a man’s world, however, Walter needs to be applauded as he is a man in power that shows equality to his female counterpart. Hawks’ portrayal of Hildy as a powerful, smart, strong, gutsy woman, that breaks the mould of the common Hollywood female stereotype has been applauded by critics and scholars. Women can resonate with the character, as not all women have a maternal instinct and would prefer a career to being a housewife.  However, the film gives the sense that if you choose a career path you will have to give up on trying to find happiness in anything other than your career. Nevertheless, His Girl Friday has been applauded for celebrating ‘difficult and anarchic love rather than security and the suburban dream.
